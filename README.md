# File_Compression
A Python-based file compression and decompression tool utilizing the Huffman Coding algorithm. This project demonstrates the application of data structures and algorithms to efficiently compress text files and reduce their size while maintaining lossless data integrity.

Features:

-> Compression: Converts input text files into compressed binary files using Huffman Coding.

-> Decompression: Restores the original text from the compressed binary file.

-> Lossless: The decompressed file matches the original file exactly.

-> Custom Implementation: Includes custom binary tree and heap-based priority queue for optimal encoding.

-> File I/O: Reads and writes files efficiently, including binary data handling and bit-level manipulation.
